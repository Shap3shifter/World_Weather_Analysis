# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to help users in planning out a vacation. The program asks the user to enter two values, a maximum and minimum temperature value (in Farenheit) to indicate the user's preference of vacation destinations based on the input temperature range. With this information, a weather database is referenced and then a DataFrame of cities are returned, detailing the set of cities that fall within the user inputs. Once the cities are gathered, that list is then referenced against Google location data to find lodging spots near or within the desired destination. The user then plans out their vacation and the program outlines the route on a map along with information about the lodging points throughout their trip.
